## Base consumer app :
I believe Base is quickly becoming the go to chain for social finance apps. Our app can help Base by providing a feature that makes social graphs across all these social finance apps composable that can seem like a quick opt-in into network effects based on the social graph architecture. In essence, I believe this could be very powerful.

## Wormhole
We believe this product could serve as a way to allow many of wormhole adopters to use it for incentivising users against any particular action in satoshis Onchain(Base chain). This could be a very useful feature for many consumer apps just like ours and shall push for utilisation or a sample utilisation in the wormhole sdk. It has been a great integrate this into our app due to easy access to mentors and docs.

## Particle auth : 
We believe the particle networkâ€™s auth and account abstraction are a perfect use in such an app like ours. This could really create a lot of identities for them and act as a pull for other projects as well that need such a web3 functionality based feature served in web2 userflow. 

## Threshold sdk :
We believe this product could serve as a way to allow many of threshold adopters to use threshold for incentivising users against any particular action in satoshis Onchain. This could be a very useful feature for many consumer apps just like ours.
